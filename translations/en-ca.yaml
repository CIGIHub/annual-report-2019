  paragraph1: 'In an increasingly digital economy, challenges posed by AI, machine learning and big data have emerged as new threats to the democratic process, with disinformation increasingly infiltrating social media feeds. At the IMF Statistical Forum in November, Jim Balsillie spoke with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and called for a “new Bretton Woods moment.” Balsillie said a coordinated international response such as that in 1944 is necessary to counter increasing geopolitical and economic turbulence resulting from a lack of international rules for the digital economy. This idea was discussed in multiple publications, including by <em>Financial Times</em> US editor Gillian Tett.'
  paragraph2: 'CIGI President Rohinton P. Medhora tackled the challenges from a policy perspective. In his policy brief <em>Rethinking Policy in a Digital World</em>, Medhora traces the rapidly changing social and economic landscape resulting from a shift away from traditional products toward “intangibles” — data and IP. New policies, he says, must be creative and reformulated for a digital age.'

Indigenous law experts, including Sa’ke’j Henderson, John Borrows, Brenda Gunn, Joshua Nichols and Sarah Morales, explore what it means to implement UNDRIP in Canada as a step on the path to genuine nation-to-nation relationships. Like a braid that gains strength from many strands woven together, the book’s authors encourage readers to imagine a process of braiding together strands of constitutional, international and Indigenous peoples’ own laws.

chairsMessage:
  paragraph1: 'At this year’s International Grand Committee (IGC) on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy meetings in Ottawa and Dublin, politicians and experts raised important questions about how social media platforms and other technology companies that operate in the data-driven economy should be governed. '
  paragraph2: 'Fears of rapidly expanding disinformation online, election interference, inequality and the rise of new monopolies, among other issues, brought new levels of scrutiny as governments scramble to fill policy and regulatory gaps in today’s economy.'
  paragraph3: 'As a think tank created to develop ideas for international governance, CIGI is demonstrating leadership in fora such as the IGC as well as the Association of Professional Executives of the Public Service of Canada (APEX), IMPACT AI and RightsCon. Supporting policy makers and others in domestic and international fora has put CIGI at the centre of governance debates. More impact is sure to come as these topics continue to rise to the forefront of public consciousness.'
  paragraph4: 'Opportunities abound for important new research and focus in areas such as intellectual property (IP), artificial intelligence (AI) — including its geopolitics, ethics, global governance and impacts on labour markets — global privacy regimes, how firms value data, cyber security and the use of technical standards as a governance tool.'
  paragraph5: 'Today’s data-driven economy poses serious issues for our governance systems as well as our industrial and social policies, which remain largely based on models built well before data became the driving economic force. I’m confident that CIGI’s contributions are well positioned to help policy makers, academics, industry and non-governmental organizations design and implement viable paths forward.'
  paragraph6: 'CIGI’s next strategic plan is for 2020–2025, and the board is looking forward to supporting a work plan that seizes on these challenges and opportunities.'

When traditional cultural expressions (TCEs) — a term developed by the World Intellectual Property Organization that includes patterns, motifs and other design features created by traditional or Indigenous cultures — are appropriated, it can cause profound cultural, social and economic harm for those who hold the TCEs.'
  paragraph2: 'CIGI Fellow Brigitte Vézina’s paper <em>Curbing Cultural Appropriation in the Fashion Industry</em> calls for reform to IP laws, as well as practical solutions for designers and consumers to put an end to cultural appropriation.

  paragraph2: 'At this inflection point — in which democracies are strained by technologies — there is a pressing need for policy makers, civil society and the private sector alike to put forth a coordinated effort to govern the digital public sphere. In response to this gap in regulation, CIGI has led discussions in Canada and internationally on frameworks for social media regulation and the impacts of disinformation. At a May 2019 hearing in Ottawa, CIGI founder and Chair Jim Balsillie and Senior Fellow Taylor Owen appeared before the IGC on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy. Balsillie made specific recommendations designed to address the threats to democracy posed by a “toxic” social media business model.'

The following were the ILRP’s three primary areas of focus: international intellectual property law, international environmental laws and treaties, and international economic, financial and investment law, regulation and governance. During the year, the provincial government terminated the agreement and indicated that the program would only be funded under the terms of the agreement until May 16, 2019. After this date, no further funding will be received for the program from the provincial government. The remaining fund balance will be utilized for future strategic opportunities according to the terms of the agreement with the private donor.'

  description: 'It is almost impossible to read the news without coming across a lead story cataloguing the latest cyber breach or misuse of data. The volume of these events lays bare the paradox of the digital economy and cyber security: technology has led to convenience, efficiency and wealth creation, but the push to digitize society quickly and relentlessly has meant building vulnerability into the core of the global economic model.'

  link3: 'Watch Neil Desai’s video about the challenges of policing cybercrime.'
  paragraph1: 'Nearly every day we read news stories about the latest cyber attack, data breach or misuse of people’s personal data. With so many attacks online, balancing the benefits of our rapidly growing digital economy while attempting to ensure security online — not to mention instilling trust among users — has become a challenge. Technology has led to convenience, efficiency and wealth creation. But the push to digitize society quickly and relentlessly has meant building vulnerability into the core of the global economic model.'
  paragraph2: 'With this paradox in mind, CIGI brought together policy makers, industry leaders and academics to create an essay series titled Governing Cyberspace during a Crisis in Trust. The digital essays and accompanying multimedia generated strong social engagement — including through a lively Twitter chat — and notable website traffic: more than 90,000 views combined in the first month. The essays were also printed as a magazine that was widely distributed to government officials and senior public servants.'

    quote: '“Cyberspace presents both threats and opportunities — at the same time — and the collective challenge is to advance policy that can best maximize the opportunities while mitigating the threats in a constantly changing global environment.”'

  paragraph1: 'The CIGI-Ipsos Global Survey on Internet Security and Trust is the world’s largest and most comprehensive survey of its kind, polling more than 25,000 internet users in over two dozen countries. Conducted by Ipsos on behalf of CIGI, in partnership with the Internet Society and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the survey provides invaluable insight into the views of internet users on a range of topics.'
  paragraph2: 'The 2019 survey results made headlines with coverage in Rappler, France 24, <em>The Economic Times</em>, <em>CTV National News</em> and <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, among others. From findings on how many people have fallen for fake news (84 percent said they had at least once) to what is causing people to distrust the internet (75 percent said social media companies, just behind cyber criminals at 81 percent), the survey provided governments, policy makers, industry leaders and others with a host of critical data to inform decisions and advance debate in the internet governance and cyber security space.'

And while Canada has had a robust history of innovation and global leadership, there is a real risk that the country will fall behind in the data and technology race. Over six months in late 2018 through early 2019, the Financial Post called on CIGI experts, including Robert Fay, Dan Ciuriak, Myra Tawfik, Jim Hinton, Bianca Wylie and others, to participate in a special series, Innovation Nation.

  paragraph1: 'Published in April 2019 to coincide with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Rwanda genocide, this book revisits the key issues of the media-genocide nexus in Rwanda and how reporting has changed with social media. <em>Media and Mass Atrocity</em> provides a critical, and often grim, review of the Rwanda genocide. It also examines other cases of mass violence and the role of terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, which use media, in particular social media, to their own advantage.'
  paragraph2: 'Edited by veteran foreign affairs journalist and CIGI Senior Fellow Allan Thompson, with contributions from frontline war correspondents and academic researchers and including a chapter and foreword by General Roméo Dallaire, the book received a great deal of media interest.

modelsForDataGovernance:
  description: 'Data trusts are occupying a politically contested space and the private sector is taking note. As a result, the public dialogue is being shaped by large, well-financed interests trying to maximize data sharing. But, large-scale privately-driven data sharing is not the only way — or even the most important way — to use data trusts.'

  link3: 'Watch Bianca Wylie and Sean McDonald explain the makeup and role of a data trust.'
  paragraph1: 'Data has become one of the world’s most valuable assets, but we are still in the early stages of developing governance frameworks that foster innovation while building and maintaining trust. CIGI’s work on the development of data standards and the role for a data trust in modern governance offers solutions to this dilemma.'
  paragraph2: 'The current lack of data standards is a significant barrier to growth for Canada’s data analytics sector. Senior Fellow Michel Girard argues standardization has the potential to increase competitiveness and set benchmarks for data governance and security. Complacency would exacerbate threats to safety and security, fundamental human rights, public institutions and democracy.'
  paragraph3: 'Public trust will be vital to the sustainability of the data economy. CIGI has contributed to the discussion on what, exactly, a data trust is, and how it can be used. A recent federal proposal to modernize Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act cited Senior Fellows Bianca Wylie and Sean McDonald’s approach to defining the role of a data trust.'

  paragraph2: 'CIGI marked the Bretton Woods anniversary with commentary from Senior Fellow James A. Haley on how the IMF should adapt to changing times, as well as a paper from C. Randall Henning on the relationship between the IMF and regional financial agreements.

  paragraph1: 'Trust is an important underlying value for CIGI’s work. But we also invest significant effort toward studying and monitoring how trust can be eroded, and the impacts this has on public discourse and our institutions. CIGI’s essay series Governing Cyberspace during a Crisis in Trust took a close look at cyber security issues including cybercrime, digital identities and the risks associated with our digital future.'
  paragraph2: 'Other key projects include our work on Canada-India relations. This major collaborative research effort with Indian think tank Gateway House continued with a meeting in Mumbai to carry forward discussions begun at a round table in Ottawa in early 2019 with government officials and experts. This year has also seen new research and opinions around economic policy making in China.'
  paragraph3: 'CIGI also published two important books: <em>Media and Mass Atrocity</em>, which looks at lessons learned from reporting on the Rwanda genocide, and <em>Braiding Legal Orders</em>, which explores relationships between international law, Indigenous peoples’ own laws and Canada’s Constitution.'
  paragraph4: 'In January, CIGI successfully launched a major report from the World Refugee Council (WRC) at the United Nations in New York City. After two years of significant results at CIGI, the work of the Council will carry on with other partners, including through Cuso International.'
  paragraph5: 'We have seen other important changes at CIGI this year. While some endeavours will be left behind, including the International Law Research Program, we are actively looking ahead to the next five years. A new strategic plan will guide CIGI’s continuing work on emerging issues. Through the lens of our digital age, it will solidify and extend ongoing work on the global economy, security and politics, and international law.'
  paragraph6: 'As we move forward, partners and funders new and old will be crucial for CIGI’s work in these areas. We thank, in particular, the Government of Canada for its ongoing support, and acknowledge the contributions from dozens of institutions and organizations. Strong partners, dedicated staff and fellows, and a formidable global governance agenda — the future is as bright as ever for CIGI!'
