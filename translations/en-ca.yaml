  paragraph1: 'In an increasingly digital economy, challenges posed by AI, machine learning and big data have emerged as new threats to the democratic process, with disinformation increasingly infiltrating social media feeds. At the IMF Statistical Forum in November, Jim Balsillie spoke with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and called for a “new Bretton Woods moment.” Balsillie said a coordinated international response such as that in 1944 is necessary to counter increasing geopolitical and economic turbulence resulting from a lack of international rules for the digital economy. This idea was discussed in multiple publications, including by <em>Financial Times</em> US editor Gillian Tett.'
  paragraph2: 'CIGI President Rohinton P. Medhora tackled the challenges from a policy perspective. In his policy brief <em>Rethinking Policy in a Digital World</em>, Medhora traces the rapidly changing social and economic landscape resulting from a shift away from traditional products toward “intangibles” — data and IP. New policies, he says, must be creative and reformulated for a digital age.'

Indigenous law experts, including Sa’ke’j Henderson, John Borrows, Brenda Gunn, Joshua Nichols and Sarah Morales, explore what it means to implement UNDRIP in Canada as a step on the path to genuine nation-to-nation relationships. Like a braid that gains strength from many strands woven together, the book’s authors encourage readers to imagine a process of braiding together strands of constitutional, international and Indigenous peoples’ own laws.

chairsMessage:
  paragraph1: 'Innovations in our digital world have significant impacts on how we communicate, conduct business and function as a society. In less than a generation, technological advances to artificial intelligence (AI) systems, driven by a wealth of big data, have led to scientific and industrial progress but also raised fears of privacy violations and a culture of mass surveillance.'
  paragraph2: 'These changes have come in such rapid succession — cryptocurrencies are quickly taking their place among financial services and AI systems based on big data have been blamed for misinformation campaigns — that they have outpaced current policies as well as global rules and regulations.'
  paragraph3: 'CIGI’s response to these questions has been timely and impactful. Through the Data Governance in the Digital Age series of essays and other work, numerous experts have proposed ways to handle data and intellectual property (IP) challenges internationally. They have also built a strong case for Canada to develop its own data strategy. Many of the ideas in the series have led to policy discussions in Ottawa and elsewhere and been discussed in editorial pages in national newspapers. The essays were collected into a printed special report, which is currently in its second printing.'
  paragraph4: 'CIGI’s leadership on data governance is crucial because big data and its management is becoming one of the important public policy issues of our time. Data’s relationship to public safety, cyber security and trade agreements, as well as privacy rights and ethical questions around AI, have a profound impact on local, national and international institutions.'
  paragraph5: 'Thanks to our partnerships with many private and public institutions, including the Governments of Canada and Ontario, and the City of Waterloo, CIGI is well positioned to insert new ideas into policy discourse and advance our collective responses to the complex challenges posed by today’s knowledge-based and data-driven global economy.'

  paragraph1: 'From luxury brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton to mainstream retailers such as Urban Outfitters, the fashion industry has developed a noticeable appetite for all things traditional, Indigenous, ethnic or folkloric. When traditional cultural expressions (TCEs) — a term developed by the World Intellectual Property Organization that includes patterns, motifs and other design features created by traditional or Indigenous cultures — are appropriated, it can cause profound cultural, social and economic harm for those who hold the TCEs.'
  paragraph2: 'CIGI Fellow Brigitte Vézina’s paper <em>Curbing Cultural Appropriation in the Fashion Industry</em> calls for reform to IP laws, as well as practical solutions for designers and consumers to put an end to cultural appropriation. The paper generated interest on social media as well as interviews with the Canadian Press and <em>The Telegraph</em>.'

  paragraph2: 'At this inflection point — in which democracies are strained by technologies — there is a pressing need for policy makers, civil society and the private sector alike to put forth a coordinated effort to govern the digital public sphere. In response to this gap in regulation, CIGI has led discussions in Canada and internationally on frameworks for social media regulation and the impacts of disinformation. At a May 2019 hearing in Ottawa, CIGI founder and Chair Jim Balsillie and Senior Fellow Taylor Owen appeared before the IGC on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy. Balsillie made specific recommendations designed to address the threats to democracy posed by a “toxic” social media business model.'

But the push to digitize society quickly and relentlessly has meant building vulnerability into the core of the global economic model.'
  paragraph2: 'With this paradox in mind, CIGI brought together policy makers, industry leaders and academics to create an essay series titled Governing Cyberspace during a Crisis in Trust. The digital essays and accompanying multimedia generated strong social engagement — including through a lively Twitter chat — and notable website traffic: more than 90,000 views combined in the first month. The essays were also printed as a magazine that was widely distributed to government officials and senior public servants.'

  paragraph1: 'The CIGI-Ipsos Global Survey on Internet Security and Trust is the world’s largest and most comprehensive survey of its kind, polling more than 25,000 internet users in over two dozen countries. Conducted by Ipsos on behalf of CIGI, in partnership with the Internet Society and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the survey provides invaluable insight into the views of internet users on a range of topics.'
  paragraph2: 'The 2019 survey results made headlines with coverage in Rappler, France 24, <em>The Economic Times</em>, <em>CTV National News</em> and <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, among others. From findings on how many people have fallen for fake news (84 percent said they had at least once) to what is causing people to distrust the internet (75 percent said social media companies, just behind cyber criminals at 81 percent), the survey provided governments, policy makers, industry leaders and others with a host of critical data to inform decisions and advance debate in the internet governance and cyber security space.'

  paragraph1: 'Published in April 2019 to coincide with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Rwanda genocide, this book revisits the key issues of the media-genocide nexus in Rwanda and how reporting has changed with social media. <em>Media and Mass Atrocity</em> provides a critical, and often grim, review of the Rwanda genocide.

  description: 'Data trusts are occupying a politically contested space and the private sector is taking note. As a result, the public dialogue is being shaped by large, well-financed interests trying to maximize data sharing. But, large-scale privately-driven data sharing is not the only way — or even the most important way — to use data trusts.'

  paragraph1: 'Data has become one of the world’s most valuable assets, but we are still in the early stages of developing governance frameworks that foster innovation while building and maintaining trust. CIGI’s work on the development of data standards and the role for a data trust in modern governance offers solutions to this dilemma.'
  paragraph2: 'The current lack of data standards is a significant barrier to growth for Canada’s data analytics sector. Senior Fellow Michel Girard argues standardization has the potential to increase competitiveness and set benchmarks for data governance and security. Complacency would exacerbate threats to safety and security, fundamental human rights, public institutions and democracy.'
  paragraph3: 'Public trust will be vital to the sustainability of the data economy. CIGI has contributed to the discussion on what, exactly, a data trust is, and how it can be used. A recent federal proposal to modernize Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act cited Senior Fellows Bianca Wylie and Sean McDonald’s approach to defining the role of a data trust.'

  paragraph1: 'Today we are witnessing dramatic changes brought on by big data, AI and automation in the workplace. More than just technological advances, these changes are fundamentally impacting our economies, democratic systems and even the fabric of our societies.'
  paragraph2: 'As a think tank focused on innovation, we have quickly brought our attention to these changes. We are assessing not only the opportunities they present but also the very real risks to citizens’ rights, international relations and the institutions we depend on, many of which are already under attack from nationalist movements.'
  paragraph3: 'Questions about online privacy and the ability for governments and other actors to meddle in democratic processes and hack institutions became increasingly relevant this year with revelations of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica and government-led misinformation campaigns. Public-private partnerships for bridging the gaps between self-regulation and other types of governance will be vital. CIGI’s work with Stanford’s Global Digital Policy Incubator, Heritage Canada and others will provide insights to protect citizens’ rights.'
  paragraph4: 'The increasingly digitalized economy also poses new challenges to the future of how we work. Through recent research and our collaboration with the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of Twenty (G20) processes, we have proposed approaches to preparing for the impacts of increased automation and AI on workforces.'
  paragraph5: 'CIGI continues to conduct in-depth research and explore policy options in many areas, all of which are affected in one way or another by the rapid changes we are seeing in the digital world driven by innovation and technological change: trade analysis on renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); women’s economic empowerment; research-based solutions to global refugee system challenges; and new work focused on trade, finance and other issues with China and India.'
  paragraph6: 'I am proud that CIGI is a leader on tackling the fundamental issues of our times. We have truly become a digital think tank for a digital era.'
